======================
StratusLab CIMI Client
======================

This project contains a CIMI (Cloud Infrastructure Management 
Interface) client.  It provides both a command line client for 
direct use and a library for programmatic access. 

Installation
============

This package is intended to be installed via pip.  The following
should 'just work':

    pip install stratuslab-cimi-client

If this is done system-wide, the PYTHONPATH and PATH should already be
set up correctly.  If this is a local installation, then you may need
to set those environmental variables by hand. 

See the tutorials on the StratusLab website on how to use the client.


Feedback
========

To provide feedback about the client or to report bugs with the code
or packaging, please send an email to support@stratuslab.eu.
